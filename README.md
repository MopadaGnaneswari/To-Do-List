# To-Do-List
Python project -Creating -ToDoList given by #technohacksedutech

A "to-do list" is a list of tasks that need to be completed, typically organized in order of priority. It's a practical tool used in personal time management, planning projects, and organizing tasks in various contexts, including home, work, and school.

Here are some key elements often found in to-do lists:

Task: This is the core element of any to-do list. It's a description of something that needs to be done. For example, "Go to the grocery store" or "Prepare for tomorrow's presentation."

Priority: Tasks on a to-do list can have a priority associated with them. For instance, tasks can be labeled as high, medium, or low priority, or they can be organized by their importance or urgency.

Due date: Some tasks might need to be completed by a certain date or time. The due date can help you plan when to start working on each task.

Status: The status of a task shows whether the task is yet to be started, in progress, or completed. It helps to keep track of the progress made on each task.

Notes: Additional notes or comments can be added to each task for further clarification, reminders or detailed instructions.

In the context of the simple Python program provided earlier, the "to-do list" is represented as a list of strings, where each string is a task that needs to be completed. The program allows you to add tasks to the list, remove tasks from the list (once they're completed), or view all the tasks on the list. However, it doesn't handle priorities, due dates, status, or notes. Those features could be added to create a more sophisticated to-do list program.
